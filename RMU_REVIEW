= Follow this steps to run:

* git clone git://github.com/chipiga/forum_engine.git

Then you can run "rails s" and login to system as:

* admin:admin

- Features:
* Only admin can create forums.
* Any user can create topic and post to it.
* Any user can edit own topics and edit/delete own posts.
* Moderator can [edit, delete] any [forum, topic, post].
* Topics with latest activity displayed on top.
* Direct link to post in topic through page calculation and anchor.
* Counts: user posts, posts in topic, posts in forum, topic views

- Uncomplete features:
* Unable post to closed topic - no interface. Set topic.state = 'closed' from console. Admin can post anyway.
* Sticky topic is displayed on top of others - no interface. Set topic.priority = 10 from console. However this feature depends on db and not working with sqlite.
* Unable to move topics between forums by arhitecture. Need special interface for admin/moderator.
